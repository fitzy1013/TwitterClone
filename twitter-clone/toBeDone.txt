- Functionality for Replies
- Ability to upload images to a tweet
- Giving proper routing/links to pages
- Further on giving tweets there own pages when interacted with 
- Filter media tweets
- Giving timestamps to tweets and then sorting by these timestamps
- Being able to search tweets and users 
- Sidebar with random accounts to follow
- Direct Messaging between accounts
- Notificiations

Options for Deleting Tweets and how to handle when it comes to the retweets
Requirements: 

1. Original Tweet to be deleted
2. Indication in any quote tweet that the original tweet has been deleted

How to be done Options: 

1. Run a api call that changes all the tweets in retweets that match the id of the tweet deleted to being empty and then when an empty is detected on the frontend can just
run text in the embed section that says "Tweet has been Deleted or is Unavailable" 

Current Issue with Retweets and Deleting Retweets

The current method is used to search for a specific tweet and username combination under a retweet
This would be applicable for retweets without a quote however when quotes are involved multiple tweets can have quotes
For the first method there should be a check to whether the retweet has a quote. This can be done by changing the search parameters
If a record is found not having a quote this method can be used. 
On the frontend it also needs to recognise in the count or activeness whether this is the case with the retweets
When an individual retwwet with quote is deleted it can just be done using only the id of the retweet

Replies Plan

- Make a child object of tweet which includes the repplied tweet and can be identified as a reply
- For the visual aspect need to create an individual page for the original tweet which will show the Replies
- Use a variation of TweetPop which has the original tweet displayed above and a line between the tweet and the reply 

-For displaying the replies will create a seperate page where onClick of a tweet it will be isolated and there will host the replies

To be done soon
refine the logic for retweets to match how it is done on Twitter

Main Step to do now is to work on how the app reacts when encountered a deleted
tweet in a quote tweet
